Ramda Guide is officially in the works now!

"Why the delay?"

Apart from having a little girl 5 months ago, battling illness, managing other
open source projects, and trying to study computer science so I can attempt a
Masters program next year, I wanted to expand my coding horizons and
opportunities by learning Rust.

For this project, I wanted to:

* have something that generates a book website for me
* write posts like this and have it build out an index page and XML (Atom) feed
* have a sitemap of all book pages _and_ news posts

Naturally, I was slightly disatisfied with everything I came across for my use
case (although [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) was nearly there), and
I decided to write a static site generator, `hull`, in Rust to handle everything
I needed.

I haven't abstracted `hull` to a standalone project yet, but you can see the
source code at [github.com/rpearce/ramda.guide/](https://github.com/rpearce/ramda.guide/).

There is still work to be done, though, but at least I can begin!

In addition to writing, some "to dos":

* identify the "Basics Track" in the outline
* implement runnable JS code examples
* style the posts better
