I had to pause writing for a bit to deal with some health issues with my wife
and daughter that are unfortunately long-term. There were some other open source
things I managed to knock out in 30 minute increments at night over a few of
months, but writing like this can hardly be done well when you're about to keel
over.

I'm resuming writing the Ramda Guide, and I'm picking back up with the
"Keep Looking Up (Object Properties)" section.
If you want to view the `prop` and `propOr` content I wrote in April, you can
check that out here: [Reading Shallow Object
Properties](https://ramda.guide/book/reading-shallow-object-properties.html). My
next task is to finish that chapter by covering `props` and `pick`, and then
move on with the rest of the core object-lookup-related chapters before checking
back in with the world.
