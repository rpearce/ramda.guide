# Documentation, Source Code, REPL, & Cookbook

[Ramda's documentation](https://ramdajs.com/docs/) is the place to go when you
are looking for a function to use, trying to remember how to use a function,
want to view a function's [source code on
GitHub](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/tree/master/source), or open it in [the
Ramda REPL](https://ramdajs.com/repl/).

[The Ramda REPL](https://ramdajs.com/repl/) is something I used _all the time_
when learning Ramda, for all the functions are automatically loaded in that
environment for you to use. You can even get a link to your current state in the
REPL and share it with others!

Some official resources of additional note are [Ramda's
GitHub wiki](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki) and the [Ramda
Cookbook](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/Cookbook). The wiki contains
numerous resources hand-picked by the Ramda folks, and the Cookbook is
chock-a-block with Ramda recipes (helpful functions built with Ramda functions).
