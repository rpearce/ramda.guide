# How to Use This Guide

## The Content

This guide's content consists of chapters grouped into related sections. Each
section has a theme that is based on the data we use as examples.

Here are some example data we will work with:

* Weather
* The International Space Station's location
* Earthquakes
* Internationalization (i18n)
* Observatories

### Explaining Code

Many examples include explanations _outside_ and _inside_ code blocks; the
latter are done via code comments. Here is an example of that:

### Advanced Content

Content that I deemed to be advanced and perhaps not immediately relevant for
newcomers is marked as "Adanced" in chapters where the advanced material is
contained.

## Meta

This guide is generated via [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Here
are some quick tips:

* Open & close the sidebar by mashing on the three vertical lines (hamburger)
  icon above
* Change the theme by mashing on the paint brush icon above
* Do a text search through the entire guide by mashing on the magnifying glass
  icon above
* Not a fan of reading on the web? Mash the printer icon above and print it or
  save to PDF
* Want to link to a specific heading? Each heading is a link you can mash, and
  then share the URL with the world

## Disclaimer / Personal Note

Even though I've worked with Ramda since 2016, programmed professionally since
2011, and taught programming for a while, I don't have a computer science degree
(yet), and I am not a Category Theory expert. The opinions in this guide stem
from my experience learning functional programming concepts through a number of
languages and making _heaps_ of mistakes along the way. There are also a lot of
people who invested in me, and I am thankful for their guidance along the path.

If you find mistakes or hold different opinions, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/rpearce/ramda.guide/issues), and we can publicly
discuss things there.

I'll never stop learning and being better than I was yesterday, and I hope that
perspective provides you, dear reader, some value as you embark on your
functional programming journey.
