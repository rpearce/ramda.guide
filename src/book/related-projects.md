Ramda is great for teams who are stepping into the functional programming in JS
world and want to dip their toes in the water. Once you've gotten comfortable
with writing code in a functional style, consider checking out these projects,
as well, to take it to the next level.

Each of these projects below include some amount of [algebraic data
types (ADTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) for safety and
expressiveness.

It should also be said that there are numerous great projects out there, so
please [open an issue](https://github.com/rpearce/ramda.guide/issues) if you'd
like to see others listed below.

## Sanctuary

[Sanctuary](https://sanctuary.js.org) is a successor to Ramda that is quite a
bit stricter and more likely to be unfamiliar to web developers, for it feels
more like [the ML
language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)).

It's goal is to provide refuge from unsafe JS. Check out [its section on
Ramda](https://sanctuary.js.org/#section:ramda) to read about the differences.

## Crocks

[Crocks](https://crocks.dev), like Sanctuary, has a bit of overlap with Ramda's
functions, but it goes much deeper than Ramda by providing a variety of ADTs
and functions for working with them.

It is worth checking out at least for its [`Async`
ADT](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Async.html) (goodbye, `Promise`)!

## Folktale

[Folktale](https://folktale.origamitower.com), like Sanctuary and Crocks,
includes some ADTs and other useful functions for working with a functional
programming style in JS.
