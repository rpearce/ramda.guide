# Where We're Going

Buckle up! We are about to begin our tour of Ramda.

We will start small and practical, getting a feel for importing and using ramda.

After some practice, we'll take a break and cover Ramda's core ideas. In this
section, we'll answer the burning "D-I-Why???" questions you will surely have.

Continuing on the path to enlightenment, we'll dive deep into various Ramda
functions and concepts, melt our minds a little bit, and come out the other
end empowered by knowledge and confident via practice.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

* understand a majority of Ramda's most valuable functions
* use functional programming to start solving problems functionally at work
* guide others
* continue on your functional programming path to enlightenment, wherever it may
  lead
