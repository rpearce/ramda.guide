# What is Ramda?

[Ramda.js](https://ramdajs.com) is a JS library of helper functions that have
some cool principles baked into every function:

* never mutate the user's data
* always provide the same output given the same input
* allow users to build new functions from old ones by not supplying all of a
  function's parameters

These ideas are thoroughly explored in the `Core Ramda Ideas` section that
starts with [the "Same Input â†’ Same Output" chapter](./core_idempotency.md).
