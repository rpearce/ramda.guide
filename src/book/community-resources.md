# Community Resources

There are a _lot_ of great articles and resources out there, and Iain's list
(see below) should cover most of your needs. If you'd like to see something on
this page, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/rpearce/ramda.guide/issues), and we can discuss
getting it added!

* Iain Freestone's [Ramda: My library of
  resources](https://dev.to/iainfreestone/ramda-my-library-of-resources-1ebm) is
  an impressive compendium of blog posts, videos, podcasts, REPLs, Ramda-related
  libraries / tools, examples, and more.
* Dave Sancho's [Learn Ramda](https://davesnx.github.io/learn-ramda/) project is
  fun and helpful, for it uses dropdown selects and English sentences to help you
  find a function based on your needs, and it tells you how to use it.
* [ramda-adjunct](https://github.com/char0n/ramda-adjunct) bills itself as "the
  most popular and most comprehensive set of functional utilities for use with
  Ramda, providing a variety of useful, well tested functions with excellent
  documentation". It is filled with useful helper functions that make working
  with Ramda even easier.
* (Shameless plug) My [Ramda
  Chops](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-function-currying.html) series
  has a few of articles that might help you with
  [currying](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-function-currying.html),
  [function composition](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-function-composition.html),
  [map, filter, & reduce](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-map-filter-and-reduce.html),
  as well as a lengthy article on [implementing your own functional
  programming-style `map` function](https://robertwpearce.com/javascript-writing-a-functional-programming-style-map-function.html).
  We'll be covering most of that content here, as well, as it was the
  inspiration for this guide!
