There were some other open source things I managed to knock out in 30 minute increments at night over a few of months, but writing like this can hardly be done well when you're about to keel over.<p>I'm resuming writing the Ramda Guide, and I'm picking back up with the "Keep Looking Up (Object Properties)" section. If you want to view the <code>prop</code> and <code>propOr</code> content I wrote in April, you can check that out here: <a href=https://ramda.guide/book/reading-shallow-object-properties.html>Reading Shallow Object Properties</a>. My next task is to finish that chapter by covering <code>props</code> and <code>pick</code>, and then move on with the rest of the core object-lookup-related chapters before checking back in with the world.</section></main>
